      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is people asking why someone is in pain if the medical exams show nothing wrong. There is also a variation of the above question: people asking why chronic pain sufferers are in pain if they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything physically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are also annoying. Infuriating, I might add. Again, I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions. However, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but ponder if people think through these questions and their impact before asking them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is the questions chronic pain sufferers get asked about if they tried some random stuff, sometimes followed by an &amp;ldquo;it worked for me for my &lt;em&gt;random non-chronic pain&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Your all body hurts? Try Yoga&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions can be more than annoying. They can be irritating. I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions; I only wonder if they really think people living with chronic pain haven&amp;rsquo;t tried everything they could possibly imagine to relieve the pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
