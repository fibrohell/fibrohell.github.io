There is also a variation of the above question: people asking why chronic pain sufferers are in pain if they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything physically wrong.
Those are also annoying. Infuriating, I might add. Again, I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions. However, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but ponder if people think through these questions and their impact before asking them.</description></item><item><title>HaVe YoU tRiEd (insert random stuff)?</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/have-you-tried/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/have-you-tried/</guid><description>One common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is the questions chronic pain sufferers get asked about if they tried some random stuff, sometimes followed by an &amp;ldquo;it worked for me for my random non-chronic pain. &amp;ldquo;Your all body hurts? Try Yoga&amp;rdquo;.
These questions can be more than annoying. They can be irritating. I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions; I only wonder if they really think people living with chronic pain haven&amp;rsquo;t tried everything they could possibly imagine to relieve the pain.</description></item></channel></rss>
