I was afraid it would make me feel even more pain. Thank Zeus it didn&amp;rsquo;t. My average pain level decreased, but not the peak level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Covid-19 symptoms I experienced were a runny nose, expectoration, cough, irritated throat, and an even higher fatigue level. Almost all of them are gone, except for the more significant fatigue feeling. Most days, I feel even more tired and have a more challenging time doing anything.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
