It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pain (I wish it were that!), but that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as much pain as usual. When people see me on days like these, they always ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m already healed. As soon as I reply &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;, they look at me like I&amp;rsquo;m lying and trying to trick them. It&amp;rsquo;s far from frustrating: it&amp;rsquo;s infuriating!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To coma or not to coma</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/to-coma-or-not-to-coma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 23:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/to-coma-or-not-to-coma/</guid><description>&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t say I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt desperate due to the constant, unbearable pain and the exhaustion fibromyalgia puts me through. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some days like this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned it too. I even wrote some of the blog posts here during those periods of diminished mental energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t also say that, as someone &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/s4tomz/i_wish_i_was_in_a_coma/">wrote on Reddit&lt;/a>, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at coma as a way of running away from the pain and the mental fatigue. Or worst escapes, but those desperate thoughts that come forward on the worst times won&amp;rsquo;t be the subject now. Maybe for another blog post. Or not. Fuck if I know. ^^'&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
