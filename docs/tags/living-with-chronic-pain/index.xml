I could never imagine how my life would be turned upside down and fucked up completely, to the point of being done for the day just for cooking a quick meal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the pain began, it made my lower back hurt like hell, and it would spread to my hips when it got worse. For more than six months, it remained like that. Eventually, it began spreading to the entirety of my back, then to my arms, legs, feet, neck&amp;hellip; I can sum it up: only my head and genitals are not impacted by the fibromyalgia pain, although my brain is DDoS&amp;rsquo;ed 24x7 from the insane number of pain signals it receives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Animal companionship in the context of chronic pain - my personal experience</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pets-and-menthal-health/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 18:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pets-and-menthal-health/</guid><description>&lt;p>Later next month, it will mark the third year going through hell, thanks to fibromyalgia. During most of this time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a pet and spent six of the seven days of the week mostly alone at home until my wife arrived from work (I visit my parents and my inlaws on Sundays if my lack of health allows it). Spending most of the day alone, coupled with the pain, was disastrous to my mental health: the thoughts of suicide occasionally lurked, especially when the pain was more intense. This culminated in an attempt to jump from my balcony. Luckily, the wife entered the apartment when I tried to climb the balcony to jump to my death.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm so sick of the bullshit around fibromyalgia</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/tired-bullshit-fibromyalgia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 19:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/tired-bullshit-fibromyalgia/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so sick of the bullshit around fibromyalgia. The latest I&amp;rsquo;ve read is an &lt;a href="https://sicnoticias.pt/saude-e-bem-estar/2023-05-12-Fibromialgia-O-medico-escreveu-felicidade-num-papel-e-deu-mo.-Foi-tudo-o-que-eu-precisei-d08b49a2">&lt;em>article&lt;/em>&lt;/a> on a Portuguese news channel website about happiness as an almost miraculous cure for this syndrome. What a bunch of steaming, stinky shit! Five fucking minutes on a search engine, and the reporter would&amp;rsquo;ve found actual medical information about this. Three examples follow below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shit like this creates a lot of obstacles to getting actual help. Instead, it helps perpetuate the habit of dosing patients with antidepressants instead of prescribing medication that actually helps deal with the pain. I&amp;rsquo;m struggling with this: my meds barely have any impact on my pain management, and I can&amp;rsquo;t get a doctor to prescribe anything stronger because&amp;hellip; happiness, antidepressants, and all that bullshit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Driven to desperation</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/driven-to-desperation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/driven-to-desperation/</guid><description>&lt;p>A couple of months ago, more or less (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact date), I was forced by Social Security to request disability. I had previously talked with a fibromyalgia association, and they told me they do this to stop paying the sick leave, which can legally last up to three years in Portugal. Forced, I requested it, but it was denied. The reasoning is that this is a cyclical syndrome. I should have periods with no pain, despite being known this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in some cases or, at best, the pain periods are very long, and the low or no pain periods are very short.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I feel defeated</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/i-feel-defeated/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/i-feel-defeated/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Portugal, you have a limit for how long you can be on sick leave uninterrupted. That limit is three years. After that, you must request a disability evaluation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on uninterrupted sick leave for almost two years. Last week, I had my latest presentation before Social Security&amp;rsquo;s medical board. In a very aggressive manner (both in language and body posture), they told me that I had 15 days to send them the request for disability or they&amp;rsquo;ll stop paying me the sick leave.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The holidays</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/the-holidays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/the-holidays/</guid><description>&lt;p>This time of the year is extra exhausting. Meeting with the family, traveling, talking, sitting down for long periods&amp;hellip; All of this and more pushed the fatigue levels to new heights!

&lt;p>Ho ho&amp;hellip; Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m beaten!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How a cat made me feel excited again</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/how-a-cat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 22:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/how-a-cat/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than two months since I last published something here. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly felt the same as I always do: pain and fatigue. I can&amp;rsquo;t forget the difficulties sleeping, the crappy memory, and the lack of motivation for everything, even getting out of bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten days ago, however, we got a six-month-old cat. This was the first time I felt genuinely excited in over two years! My days were mostly spent alone at home, watching something and/or browsing the web to pass the time; sometimes, I even played Football Manager if I had the mental energy to do it. I only got company at night when my wife arrived from work, but by then, I was feeling even more tired, unmotivated, and with no focus ability. Now, I have Chico Petisco to keep me company and &lt;em>chill&lt;/em> with me on the couch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm terrified about my future</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/terrified-about-my-future/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/terrified-about-my-future/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 16th, I&amp;rsquo;ll be 39, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more terrified of my future in my whole life. The pain has been getting more intense in the last few months, and I fear it will worsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My days are spent lying down on the couch and/or on the bed, feeling pain 24/7, not resting well when I&amp;rsquo;m able to sleep, not sleeping because the pain keeps me awake, and having my brain totally fucked up and tired&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m frightened about my future. It scares the shit out of me to have to live the rest of my life like this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vacations and the toll on the body</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/vacations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:01:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/vacations/</guid><description>&lt;p>The wife is on vacation this week, and, since last week, she&amp;rsquo;s been trying to butter me up to go with her to the beach because she knows how painful these things can be for me, and I usually decline. We haven&amp;rsquo;t done something like this in a while, so we both wanted to do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday, we arrived a little before lunch so we could eat something and then chill in the sand for a while. We were fortunate enough to find a seat in a restaurant a few meters from the beach, but not so much with the waiting time. When we started eating, my lower back was hurting like crazy - I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even stop shaking my leg.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Types of pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/types-of-pain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 22:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/types-of-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since my pain started, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced what I would classify as three different types of pain: two of them are more common, and one is rare. Usually, I feel one of them with high intensity and another with low intensity; on occasion, the three simultaneously have the same intenseness or different levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common ones are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Feeling soared, like after receiving a solid kick in the muscles or being hit with a baseball bat (or something like that);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like having needles piercing my muscles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rarer one feels like I&amp;rsquo;m having my nerves being pulled with a hook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cannabis and pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/cannabis-pain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 05:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/cannabis-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the pain from fibromyalgia started, I tried a lot of stuff to ease my suffering. I took lots of different pills, did physiotherapy, tried exercising but stopped because even light exercise increased the pain, meditation, and so on. One time, by the end of November 2020, I tried CBD. It worked at the time, but I only started to feel the effects on the first days of December that year, when I returned to work. They lasted until February 2021, when the pain increased again no matter how much CBD I took.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About the good of humankind</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/about-the-good-of-humankind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:55:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/about-the-good-of-humankind/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago, I confided with some folks that things were getting a bit hard on the money side. My sick leave is meagre at best. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough for all the medication - not just for the fibromyalgia - I take during the month and for my monthly appointment and related costs (like gas and tolls). The wife works - and a lot, on top of that. Since I was forced to go on sick leave, she&amp;rsquo;s had to support all the costs like rent, food, and utility bills&amp;hellip; You can only stretch the money so much before it rips.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Covid, Fibromyalgia, and an increase in fatigue</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fibromyalgia-covid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fibromyalgia-covid/</guid><description>&lt;p>Around two weeks ago, I began to experience Covid-19 symptoms. I was afraid it would make me feel even more pain. Thank Zeus it didn&amp;rsquo;t. My average pain level decreased, but not the peak level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Covid-19 symptoms I experienced were a runny nose, expectoration, cough, irritated throat, and an even higher fatigue level. Almost all of them are gone, except for the more significant fatigue feeling. Most days, I feel even more tired and have a more challenging time doing anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A walk in the park</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/a-walk-in-the-park/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 17:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/a-walk-in-the-park/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 10th, the wife and I went to a park within walking distance from home to celebrate her negative Covid test. It takes less than 5 minutes to get there on foot. Still, it took us ~15 minutes because I was walking super slow and with considerable difficulties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we arrived, I was with one foot to the grave. I had to sit for a while (but I actually wanted to lay down on the floor), and then I proceeded to take some photos. I felt super happy hanging out with her in a lovely park and shooting pictures, which depleted my energy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fifth appointment - quick notes</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fifth-appointment-quick-note/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 21:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fifth-appointment-quick-note/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was thinking about only writing about my fifth low intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation after a few days. Still, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel a significant decrease in pain, I decided to write a blog post today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The appointment was yesterday. It came after one of the worst months, just like last month. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt the average pain intensity has increased. Those are two factors that should be accounted for when judging the effects of the treatment.
After the appointment, I felt a lot of relief, but less than with the previous appointments. Even the previous one made me feel less pain, and that one didn&amp;rsquo;t provide as much pain relief as the previous ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fourth appointment</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fourth-appointment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 02:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/fourth-appointment/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the fifth of this month, I had my fourth transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment. It was supposed to be by the end of March. Sadly, money doesn&amp;rsquo;t stretch, and I had to reschedule it, even though I sorely needed it. March was one of the worst months I had so far: I spent most of that month only sleeping every other day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The day of the appointment came, and I was exhausted and in much pain. Fortunately, the therapy relieved that, and I left the centre feeling much better. Yet, not as good as in the other appointments. I assume this was because, as I wrote above, I was coming from one of the worst months.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding purpose</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/finding-purpose/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/finding-purpose/</guid><description>&lt;p>Suffering from pain 24/7 can deprive you of a sense of purpose. Suddenly, you find yourself dependent on others; accomplishing the most basic tasks is a huge struggle; you feel useless and a hindrance to everyone around you. &amp;ldquo;Why am I so useless?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Why me?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;This is no way to live&amp;rdquo; will be some thoughts that will frequently go through your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can you find a sense of purpose if your body and mind take a beating from chronic pain? I began to struggle with this thought not long after the pain started. Every time, I felt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t entirely trust my brain because it was always too tired, too sleep-deprived, and too confused. Yet, every time, the solution I could think of to find purpose in life again was to fight against the discrimination people with fibromyalgia go through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I had a chronic pain appointment that made me feel even more pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/chronic-pain-appointment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/chronic-pain-appointment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I had a chronic pain appointment. It was insanely painful! I had to wait almost an hour to see the doctor, sitting in super uncomfortable chairs, and left there with more pain than when I entered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This fucked up my sleep completely. I spent the night awake, in a lot of pain. After returning home, I prepared five (or was it six? i lost count) hot water bottles and had to take a boiling bath. It took me more than twelve hours to start to feel some very minor relief, and that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to allow me to sleep, even if by morning. I&amp;rsquo;m super sleepy, but I can sleep because I&amp;rsquo;m still in too much pain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Messed up sleep continues</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/messed-up-sleep-continues/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 18:15:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/messed-up-sleep-continues/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought my sleep issues mainly had stabilized for a few months now. I have, on average, two nights without sleep, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. Long gone are the days when I slept, at most, twelve hours in a whole week. Or so I thought&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last two weeks have been&amp;hellip; hum&amp;hellip; demanding in that regard. When I sleep, it&amp;rsquo;s usually six hours top, with one sleeping between ten and twelve because the fatigue builds up and eventually gets too much to bear. The sleepless nights have been three a week. And the sleep quality hasn&amp;rsquo;t been that great, either.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Medical board to me: fuck you very much</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/medical-board-doesnt-give-a-crap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 14:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/medical-board-doesnt-give-a-crap/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 28th, I had to present myself again before a medical board. This time, I was not insulted, screamed at or any other crazy stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced with them before. However, I was told Social Security would stop paying me my sick leave very soon. They also said that I should consider disability retirement. There&amp;rsquo;s only one thing about disability retirement: I don&amp;rsquo;t want it, and Social Security doesn&amp;rsquo;t give it to people who live with fibromyalgia, no matter how much it impacts their lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High level, non-stopping</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/high-level-never-ending/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 07:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/high-level-never-ending/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been seeing this image on some subreddits, and I can’t imagine how great it would be if my pain was a never-ending, low-level one. I swear to Cthulhu, it would be amazing! No more sleepless nights because the pain is too much to bear, so much less brain fog and fucked up memory. Granted, I do have a couple of days of relief after the appointments, but even that starts to degrade fast hours after finishing the treatment session.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How it felt after the third appointment</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/third-appointment-report/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 07:05:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/third-appointment-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 10th of February, I had the third transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment. I felt a mix of excitement and expectation and a fear the relief would be shorter than it has been or never exist again. In terms of percentages, it was around 80% excitement and 20% fear. That and a total dose of lack of sleep on the previous night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My fear was unfounded, thank Zeus! The relief started making itself feel mid-appointment. During that day, it only decreased during the two-hour ride home, which was expected. As soon as we got home, I went to bed and slept like a 10-ton rock.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tracking the therapy progress</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/tracking-therapy-progress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/tracking-therapy-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since I started transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted an easy way for me to keep track of its effects. I carried out trials with a few methods, but they all fell short.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I experimented with writing text/markdown/org files, but it got messier as the notes grew. Then, dedicated simple note-taking software like Google Keep, but this method had the same issues as the text files. I needed context, relationships and simple search, and none of the methods above had all of these prerequisites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Third appointment done</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/third-appointment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/third-appointment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, the 10th, I had my third transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment. Unlike &lt;a href="https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment/">last time&lt;/a>, there was no delay; I believe it was because I was the day&amp;rsquo;s first patient. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be the first again on the next one because it&amp;rsquo;s scheduled for the same hour as yesterday. Even if I&amp;rsquo;m not the first, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the first, which means I probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to wait much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I felt that fantastic relaxation feeling in my body. This time, it started during the first part of the treatment, not by the end like the previous two appointments, and only increased from there. When I left the office, I was smiling. That was crazy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better on the surface</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/better-on-the-surface/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/better-on-the-surface/</guid><description>&lt;p>I sometimes have a few days when I can walk, mostly normal, and I don&amp;rsquo;t spend the entire day complaining about the pain. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pain (I wish it were that!), but that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as much pain as usual. When people see me on days like these, they always ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m already healed. As soon as I reply &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;, they look at me like I&amp;rsquo;m lying and trying to trick them. It&amp;rsquo;s far from frustrating: it&amp;rsquo;s infuriating!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/more-high-intensity-pain-spots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 05:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/more-high-intensity-pain-spots/</guid><description>&lt;p>By now, I should&amp;rsquo;ve been used to how the pain changes and fluctuates. I am not. I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to having the most hurting part of my body change from one place to the other, causing mixed difficulties as it travels - usually on my upper body. And I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to the changes in intensity, always between high levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since about two weeks ago, I have had one more shit to get used to: having multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time. Yes: not one part of the body with the highest pain level, but two or more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farto desta merda</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/farto-desta-merda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 18:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/farto-desta-merda/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alguma vez se sentiram cansados de tudo e sem energia para continuar?

&lt;p>Dormir é uma luta, o meu sono está sempre todo fodido: ou não durmo por causa das dores, por causa do stress disto ou, o mais habitual, por causa das duas coisas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Desde que isto começou, as minhas finanças ficaram viradas do avesso. Passei a part-time para tentar continuar a trabalhar, mas nem assim consegui aguentar.

&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t also say that, as someone &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/s4tomz/i_wish_i_was_in_a_coma/">wrote on Reddit&lt;/a>, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at coma as a way of running away from the pain and the mental fatigue. Or worst escapes, but those desperate thoughts that come forward on the worst times won&amp;rsquo;t be the subject now. Maybe for another blog post. Or not.

I was hoping it was only a fad, and things would stabilize on a somewhat manageable pain level. Again, luck had other plans for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things have been bad, but today tops the last week. I woke up with a crazy ton of pain in my body, and it took me more than one hour to get out of bed - my muscles were (and are) really stiff and soared.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The pain relief didn't last long</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-increase-back/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 01:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-increase-back/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought the effects would last longer when I published the previous blog post. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about them enduring a whole week, but at least five days. Not this time; maybe next time. Even so, it lasted longer than last month, so I call it progress, and I keep myself hopeful about this treatment!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirty minutes, more or less, after publishing that blog post, I started feeling an increase in the pain intensity. It went from a 2.0, on a scale of 0 to 10, to a 4.5 in a heartbeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Still feeling the treatment effects</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment-less-pain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 01:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment-less-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s already past 1 AM here in Portugal. I was expecting yesterday would be a day with more pain than usual, just like last month, three days after my first transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pessimistic as it may sound, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s better, in this particular case, to be prepared for the worse in case it happens. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice and pleasant surprise, don&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, the worst-case scenario didn&amp;rsquo;t come to fruition. My body hurt more than the day of the appointment and the next day after it, but it was manageable. I admit I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much yesterday, but that was also the case in basically all my worst pain days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Second transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 01:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I had my second appointment for transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment I&amp;rsquo;m undertaking to decrease and manage my pain levels associated with the fibromyalgia I was diagnosed with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The consultation had a two-hour delay, far from an ideal situation. It&amp;rsquo;s 200kms from my home to the medical centre, so waiting 2 hours, having arrived on time, it&amp;rsquo;s bothersome, to say the least. While I was waiting, I had to shift between sitting and standing up to minimize the increase in the pain level, but in the end, it was worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starting 2022 worst than I ended 2021</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/starting-2022-with-left-foot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 04:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/starting-2022-with-left-foot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two days after Christmas, I &lt;a href="https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/hellidays/">wrote&lt;/a> about how painful and tiring the holiday was for me.

&lt;p>Although a quiet one, the New Year celebration was also expected to be painful and tiring. It was. No surprise here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After these holidays, I thought I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get worse than I already was - a few days to recover, and that would be it. Wrong!

&lt;p>On Christmas Eve, I stayed at home during the morning and almost all afternoon. Thank Zeus for that. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep the previous night, only a few hours during the morning.

&lt;p>While not life-threatening, I have a severe form of this syndrome. In most cases, people have light symptoms; I, however, can&amp;rsquo;t go without medication, can&amp;rsquo;t get too stressed and can&amp;rsquo;t eat a lot of stuff.

On the first day, as I &lt;a href="https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/first-transcranial-neurostimulation-appointment/">wrote&lt;/a> before, a tingling sensation started right after the therapy (well, technically, it began during it), and it increased a little as time went by. In over a year, it was the first time that I felt my body relaxing, so it felt terrific.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the 200km ride back home was tiring. When we got home, I had to go straight to the couch. My body was aching, but not as much as it would before.

&lt;p>The wife and I drove 200kms to the medical centre, the only one in Portugal with a unit dedicated exclusively to this syndrome, located in Covilhã, a city in the country&amp;rsquo;s interior region.

&lt;p>My body feels like it&amp;rsquo;s broken and all soared. My arms, legs, lower back, and shoulder blades all hurt a lot. And I mean a lot!

I can only do most of them when I&amp;rsquo;m not also feeling exhausted, a state that I&amp;rsquo;m frequently in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I have the energy, I do at least one of the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>talk to the wife when she&amp;rsquo;s at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>call my parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>visit my parents or my in-laws&lt;/li>
&lt;li>snap some photographs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>volunteer with &lt;a href="https://fosshost.org">Fosshost&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>listen to some &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gFhR0cDZHuGGCCGhgDjAB?si=00d1925bf7b64b27">music&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>read online articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>play Football Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Having activities to do is, I believe, very important to keep the mind as sane as possible and avoid going through the rabbit hole of depression.

There is also a variation of the above question: people asking why chronic pain sufferers are in pain if they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything physically wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are also annoying. Infuriating, I might add. Again, I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions. However, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but ponder if people think through these questions and their impact before asking them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another sleepless night</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-insomnia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-insomnia/</guid><description>&lt;p>This night was another sleepless one. Too much pain, even with hot water bottles. With luck, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to fall asleep for a few hours during the morning or the afternoon. Fingers crossed (not really because they hurt).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I hate cold weather</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/i-hate-cold-weather/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 06:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/i-hate-cold-weather/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cold temperatures arrived in Portugal. With them came an increase in the pain level. What was already bad just became worst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was never a big fan of cold, except when I could spend the day in bed, all cosied up. Since fibromyalgia came into my life, it’s different: I can’t spend a whole day laying down because it will make my body hurt even more, and the cold makes the pain even worst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An average pain level of 6, on a 0 to 10 scale, is now a 7.5. Bear in mind this is a revised scale. Using the previous one, the numbers would be 8 and 9.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HaVe YoU tRiEd (insert random stuff)?</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/have-you-tried/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/have-you-tried/</guid><description>&lt;p>One common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is the questions chronic pain sufferers get asked about if they tried some random stuff, sometimes followed by an &amp;ldquo;it worked for me for my &lt;em>random non-chronic pain&lt;/em>. &amp;ldquo;Your all body hurts? Try Yoga&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These questions can be more than annoying. They can be irritating. I won&amp;rsquo;t judge the intention when people ask these questions; I only wonder if they really think people living with chronic pain haven&amp;rsquo;t tried everything they could possibly imagine to relieve the pain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
