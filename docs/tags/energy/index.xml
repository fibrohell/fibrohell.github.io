      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time of the year is extra exhausting. Meeting with the family, traveling, talking, sitting down for long periods&amp;hellip; All of this and more pushed the fatigue levels to new heights! It&amp;rsquo;s even worse with the pain level!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ho ho&amp;hellip; Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m beaten!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Covid, Fibromyalgia, and an increase in fatigue</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around two weeks ago, I began to experience Covid-19 symptoms. I was afraid it would make me feel even more pain. Thank Zeus it didn&amp;rsquo;t. My average pain level decreased, but not the peak level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 symptoms I experienced were a runny nose, expectoration, cough, irritated throat, and an even higher fatigue level. Almost all of them are gone, except for the more significant fatigue feeling. Most days, I feel even more tired and have a more challenging time doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A walk in the park</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 10th, the wife and I went to a park within walking distance from home to celebrate her negative Covid test. It takes less than 5 minutes to get there on foot. Still, it took us ~15 minutes because I was walking super slow and with considerable difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, I was with one foot to the grave. I had to sit for a while (but I actually wanted to lay down on the floor), and then I proceeded to take some photos. I felt super happy hanging out with her in a lovely park and shooting pictures, which depleted my energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another very, very bad day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days I don&amp;rsquo;t even get some pain relief by lying down. Well, it started yesterday, when I woke up. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was for sleeping too much time in the same position, bad luck, or whatever the fuck it was, but all I know is I woke up in tremendous pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My body feels like it&amp;rsquo;s broken and all soared. My arms, legs, lower back, and shoulder blades all hurt a lot. And I mean a lot! Writing this is painful, and I have to do it slowly, or I might scream. I can&amp;rsquo;t even think straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the memories I have from my childhood and teenage years have in common that &lt;strong&gt;I never ran out of energy, like the Duracell bunny&lt;/strong&gt;. During summer, It was usual for my colleagues from my home town and me to play futsal for more than four straight hours. &lt;strong&gt;Playing a whole morning and an entire afternoon was also not uncommon, just like going to parties after the matches to get drunk and playing another futsal match the next day wasn&amp;rsquo;t too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
