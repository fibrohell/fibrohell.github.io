We haven&amp;rsquo;t done something like this in a while, so we both wanted to do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday, we arrived a little before lunch so we could eat something and then chill in the sand for a while. We were fortunate enough to find a seat in a restaurant a few meters from the beach, but not so much with the waiting time. When we started eating, my lower back was hurting like crazy - I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even stop shaking my leg.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Types of pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/types-of-pain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 22:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/types-of-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since my pain started, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced what I would classify as three different types of pain: two of them are more common, and one is rare. Usually, I feel one of them with high intensity and another with low intensity; on occasion, the three simultaneously have the same intenseness or different levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common ones are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Feeling soared, like after receiving a solid kick in the muscles or being hit with a baseball bat (or something like that);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like having needles piercing my muscles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rarer one feels like I&amp;rsquo;m having my nerves being pulled with a hook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cannabis and pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/cannabis-pain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 05:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/cannabis-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the pain from fibromyalgia started, I tried a lot of stuff to ease my suffering. I took lots of different pills, did physiotherapy, tried exercising but stopped because even light exercise increased the pain, meditation, and so on. One time, by the end of November 2020, I tried CBD. It worked at the time, but I only started to feel the effects on the first days of December that year, when I returned to work. They lasted until February 2021, when the pain increased again no matter how much CBD I took.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/more-high-intensity-pain-spots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 05:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/more-high-intensity-pain-spots/</guid><description>&lt;p>By now, I should&amp;rsquo;ve been used to how the pain changes and fluctuates. I am not. I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to having the most hurting part of my body change from one place to the other, causing mixed difficulties as it travels - usually on my upper body. And I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to the changes in intensity, always between high levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since about two weeks ago, I have had one more shit to get used to: having multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time. Yes: not one part of the body with the highest pain level, but two or more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To coma or not to coma</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/to-coma-or-not-to-coma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 23:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/to-coma-or-not-to-coma/</guid><description>&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t say I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt desperate due to the constant, unbearable pain and the exhaustion fibromyalgia puts me through. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some days like this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned it too. I even wrote some of the blog posts here during those periods of diminished mental energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t also say that, as someone &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/s4tomz/i_wish_i_was_in_a_coma/">wrote on Reddit&lt;/a>, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at coma as a way of running away from the pain and the mental fatigue. Or worst escapes, but those desperate thoughts that come forward on the worst times won&amp;rsquo;t be the subject now. Maybe for another blog post. Or not. Fuck if I know. ^^'&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
