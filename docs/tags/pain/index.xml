      <description>The wife is on vacation this week, and, since last week, she&amp;rsquo;s been trying to butter me up to go with her to the beach because she knows how painful these things can be for me, and I usually decline. We haven&amp;rsquo;t done something like this in a while, so we both wanted to do something.
On Monday, we arrived a little before lunch so we could eat something and then chill in the sand for a while.</description>

      <title>Types of pain</title>

      <description>Ever since my pain started, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced what I would classify as three different types of pain: two of them are more common, and one is rare. Usually, I feel one of them with high intensity and another with low intensity; on occasion, the three simultaneously have the same intenseness or different levels.
The most common ones are:
Feeling soared, like after receiving a solid kick in the muscles or being hit with a baseball bat (or something like that); Like having needles piercing my muscles.</description>

      <description>Since the pain from fibromyalgia started, I tried a lot of stuff to ease my suffering. I took lots of different pills, did physiotherapy, tried exercising but stopped because even light exercise increased the pain, meditation, and so on. One time, by the end of November 2020, I tried CBD. It worked at the time, but I only started to feel the effects on the first days of December that year, when I returned to work.</description>

      <title>Multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time</title>

      <description>By now, I should&amp;rsquo;ve been used to how the pain changes and fluctuates. I am not. I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to having the most hurting part of my body change from one place to the other, causing mixed difficulties as it travels - usually on my upper body. And I can&amp;rsquo;t get used to the changes in intensity, always between high levels.
Since about two weeks ago, I have had one more shit to get used to: having multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time.</description>

      <title>To coma or not to coma</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t say I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt desperate due to the constant, unbearable pain and the exhaustion fibromyalgia puts me through. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some days like this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned it too. I even wrote some of the blog posts here during those periods of diminished mental energy.
I can&amp;rsquo;t also say that, as someone wrote on Reddit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at coma as a way of running away from the pain and the mental fatigue. Or worst escapes, but those desperate thoughts that come forward on the worst times won&amp;rsquo;t be the subject now.</description>
