Unlike last time, there was no delay; I believe it was because I was the day&amp;rsquo;s first patient. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be the first again on the next one because it&amp;rsquo;s scheduled for the same hour as yesterday. Even if I&amp;rsquo;m not the first, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one of the first, which means I probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to wait much.
Again, I felt that fantastic relaxation feeling in my body.</description></item><item><title>The pain relief didn't last long</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-increase-back/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 01:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/pain-increase-back/</guid><description>I thought the effects would last longer when I published the previous blog post. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about them enduring a whole week, but at least five days. Not this time; maybe next time. Even so, it lasted longer than last month, so I call it progress, and I keep myself hopeful about this treatment!
Thirty minutes, more or less, after publishing that blog post, I started feeling an increase in the pain intensity. It went from a 2.</description></item><item><title>Still feeling the treatment effects</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment-less-pain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 01:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment-less-pain/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s already past 1 AM here in Portugal. I was expecting yesterday would be a day with more pain than usual, just like last month, three days after my first transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment.
Pessimistic as it may sound, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s better, in this particular case, to be prepared for the worse in case it happens. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice and pleasant surprise, don&amp;rsquo;t you agree?
Well, the worst-case scenario didn&amp;rsquo;t come to fruition.</description></item><item><title>Transcranial magnetic stimulation medical appointment scheduled</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-appointment-scheduled/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 15:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-appointment-scheduled/</guid><description>Today, I received a call from the only medical centre in Portugal dedicated to fibromyalgia. They wanted to schedule the first appointment with me.
When I called them to schedule it, they told me they were only registering contacts and that the appointments would only be from January forward. However, today, they scheduled it for next week. I&amp;rsquo;m super excited!</description></item><item><title>Study shows that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation can help decrease the pain</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 06:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/</guid><description>Two weeks ago, if memory serves me right, I watched the news on TV about a centre dedicated to fibromyalgia opening here I&amp;rsquo;m Portugal. They are performing a study using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which got my attention. I searched for publications about this treatment and got my hands on a 2010 research.
In the study, the authors hypothesize, based on previous works, that dysfunctions in the central nervous system related to changes in central pain processing could be the cause.</description></item></channel></rss>
