They are performing a study using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which got my attention. I searched for publications about this treatment and got my hands on a 2010 research.
In the study, the authors hypothesize, based on previous works, that dysfunctions in the central nervous system related to changes in central pain processing could be the cause.</description></item><item><title>List of recent fibromyalgia studies</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/list-of-studies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 03:42:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/list-of-studies/</guid><description>I compiled, below, a small list of recent fibromyalgia scientific studies with open access so that people diagnosed with it can better understand the syndrome and find ways to improve symptoms management. Also, people who don&amp;rsquo;t have it can better understand how much patients diagnosed with it suffer.

Default mode network changes in fibromyalgia patients are largely dependent on current clinical pain

The research is being developed by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp;amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London, collaborating with the University of Liverpool and the Karolinska Institute.
Fibromyalgia patients suffer from several symptoms, such as pain sensitivity, muscle weakness, increased fatigue, reduced movement, and reduced number of small nerve fibres in the skin. The research is revealing the root of these symptoms is antibodies that increase the activity of pain-sensing nerves throughout the body.</description></item></channel></rss>
