      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, more or less (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact date), I was forced by Social Security to request disability. I had previously talked with a fibromyalgia association, and they told me they do this to stop paying the sick leave, which can legally last up to three years in Portugal. Forced, I requested it, but it was denied. The reasoning is that this is a cyclical syndrome. I should have periods with no pain, despite being known this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in some cases or, at best, the pain periods are very long, and the low or no pain periods are very short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 28th, I had to present myself again before a medical board. This time, I was not insulted, screamed at or any other crazy stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced with them before. However, I was told Social Security would stop paying me my sick leave very soon. They also said that I should consider disability retirement. There&amp;rsquo;s only one thing about disability retirement: I don&amp;rsquo;t want it, and Social Security doesn&amp;rsquo;t give it to people who live with fibromyalgia, no matter how much it impacts their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
