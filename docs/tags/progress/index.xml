      <description>Yesterday was the third day after the first transcranial neurostimulation session. On the first day, as I wrote before, a tingling sensation started right after the therapy (well, technically, it began during it), and it increased a little as time went by. In over a year, it was the first time that I felt my body relaxing, so it felt terrific.
Unfortunately, the 200km ride back home was tiring. When we got home, I had to go straight to the couch.</description>
