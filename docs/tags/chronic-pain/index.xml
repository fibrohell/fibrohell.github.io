Meeting with the family, traveling, talking, sitting down for long periods&amp;hellip; All of this and more pushed the fatigue levels to new heights! It&amp;rsquo;s even worse with the pain level!&lt;/p>

It was insanely painful! I had to wait almost an hour to see the doctor, sitting in super uncomfortable chairs, and left there with more pain than when I entered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This fucked up my sleep completely. I spent the night awake, in a lot of pain. After returning home, I prepared five (or was it six? i lost count) hot water bottles and had to take a boiling bath. It took me more than twelve hours to start to feel some very minor relief, and that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to allow me to sleep, even if by morning. I&amp;rsquo;m super sleepy, but I can sleep because I&amp;rsquo;m still in too much pain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
