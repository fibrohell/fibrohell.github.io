Meeting with the family, traveling, talking, sitting down for long periods&amp;hellip; All of this and more pushed the fatigue levels to new heights! It&amp;rsquo;s even worse with the pain level!

It was insanely painful! I had to wait almost an hour to see the doctor, sitting in super uncomfortable chairs, and left there with more pain than when I entered.
This fucked up my sleep completely. I spent the night awake, in a lot of pain. After returning home, I prepared five (or was it six? i lost count) hot water bottles and had to take a boiling bath.</description></item></channel></rss>
