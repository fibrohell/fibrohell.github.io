      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m in pain, which is every second of every day, I try to find stuff that helps me distract from it. I can only do most of them when I&amp;rsquo;m not also feeling exhausted, a state that I&amp;rsquo;m frequently in.
If I have the energy, I do at least one of the following:
 talk to the wife when she&amp;rsquo;s at home call my parents visit my parents or my in-laws snap some photographs volunteer with Fosshost watch TV listen to some music read online articles play Football Manager  Having activities to do is, I believe, very important to keep the mind as sane as possible and avoid going through the rabbit hole of depression.</description>
