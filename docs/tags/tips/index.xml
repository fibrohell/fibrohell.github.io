I can only do most of them when I&amp;rsquo;m not also feeling exhausted, a state that I&amp;rsquo;m frequently in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I have the energy, I do at least one of the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>talk to the wife when she&amp;rsquo;s at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>call my parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>visit my parents or my in-laws&lt;/li>
&lt;li>snap some photographs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>volunteer with &lt;a href="https://fosshost.org">Fosshost&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>watch TV&lt;/li>
&lt;li>listen to some &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gFhR0cDZHuGGCCGhgDjAB?si=00d1925bf7b64b27">music&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>read online articles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>play Football Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Having activities to do is, I believe, very important to keep the mind as sane as possible and avoid going through the rabbit hole of depression. People struggling with chronic pain know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I started cooking after fibromyalgia</title><link>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/how-i-cook-and-avoid-increase-in-pain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 11:37:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/how-i-cook-and-avoid-increase-in-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>When I started feeling the pain caused by fibromyalgia, I was forced to avoid tasks like cleaning the house.&lt;/strong> I tried to do it before deciding I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but it hurt like hell and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish It, so I had to let my beautiful wife do this one. Other tasks, however, I was able to keep doing, like cooking, but I had to adapt the way I do them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And it&amp;rsquo;s about how I adapted the way I do cooking I&amp;rsquo;m writing. Cooking forces me to stand up with minimal movement, and that causes me even more pain.&lt;/strong> My back hurts more, I get pain in the legs and it feels like I can sense every nerve and muscle fibre on them being stretched to the point of almost breakage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
