      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m in pain, which is every second of every day, I try to find stuff that helps me distract from it. I can only do most of them when I&amp;rsquo;m not also feeling exhausted, a state that I&amp;rsquo;m frequently in.
If I have the energy, I do at least one of the following:
talk to the wife when she&amp;rsquo;s at home call my parents visit my parents or my in-laws snap some photographs volunteer with Fosshost watch TV listen to some music read online articles play Football Manager Having activities to do is, I believe, very important to keep the mind as sane as possible and avoid going through the rabbit hole of depression.</description>

      <description>When I started feeling the pain caused by fibromyalgia, I was forced to avoid tasks like cleaning the house. I tried to do it before deciding I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but it hurt like hell and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish It, so I had to let my beautiful wife do this one. Other tasks, however, I was able to keep doing, like cooking, but I had to adapt the way I do them.
And it&amp;rsquo;s about how I adapted the way I do cooking I&amp;rsquo;m writing.</description>
