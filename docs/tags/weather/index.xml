      <title>How I keep an increase of pain at bay on family days</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All the doctors I&amp;rsquo;ve seen have told me I need to leave the house and mingle. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done it much because I&amp;rsquo;m always in pain, and spending a day with the family can be exhausting and painful. I took their advice and every Sunday I try to spend it with my parents or her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing it and avoiding the crazy amount of fatigue and pain associated with these days takes some planning. I can&amp;rsquo;t spend all day standing up, but I also can&amp;rsquo;t spend it sitting down on uncomfortable chairs, or I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The days keep getting colder and colder, and bearing my pain harder and harder. I write this semi-sitting on the bed, with my back against two pillows, my fingers hurting like crazy, my body hurting even more just for existing. I fucking hate the cold weather!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cold temperatures arrived in Portugal. With them came an increase in the pain level. What was already bad just became worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was never a big fan of cold, except when I could spend the day in bed, all cosied up. Since fibromyalgia came into my life, it’s different: I can’t spend a whole day laying down because it will make my body hurt even more, and the cold makes the pain even worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An average pain level of 6, on a 0 to 10 scale, is now a 7.5. Bear in mind this is a revised scale. Using the previous one, the numbers would be 8 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
