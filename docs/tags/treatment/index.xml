      <title>How it felt after the third appointment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 10th of February, I had the third transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment. I felt a mix of excitement and expectation and a fear the relief would be shorter than it has been or never exist again. In terms of percentages, it was around 80% excitement and 20% fear. That and a total dose of lack of sleep on the previous night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My fear was unfounded, thank Zeus! The relief started making itself feel mid-appointment. During that day, it only decreased during the two-hour ride home, which was expected. As soon as we got home, I went to bed and slept like a 10-ton rock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The pain relief didn&#39;t last long</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought the effects would last longer when I published the previous blog post. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about them enduring a whole week, but at least five days. Not this time; maybe next time. Even so, it lasted longer than last month, so I call it progress, and I keep myself hopeful about this treatment!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes, more or less, after publishing that blog post, I started feeling an increase in the pain intensity. It went from a 2.0, on a scale of 0 to 10, to a 4.5 in a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already past 1 AM here in Portugal. I was expecting yesterday would be a day with more pain than usual, just like last month, three days after my first transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pessimistic as it may sound, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s better, in this particular case, to be prepared for the worse in case it happens. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice and pleasant surprise, don&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the worst-case scenario didn&amp;rsquo;t come to fruition. My body hurt more than the day of the appointment and the next day after it, but it was manageable. I admit I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much yesterday, but that was also the case in basically all my worst pain days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Second transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had my second appointment for transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment I&amp;rsquo;m undertaking to decrease and manage my pain levels associated with the fibromyalgia I was diagnosed with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consultation had a two-hour delay, far from an ideal situation. It&amp;rsquo;s 200kms from my home to the medical centre, so waiting 2 hours, having arrived on time, it&amp;rsquo;s bothersome, to say the least. While I was waiting, I had to shift between sitting and standing up to minimize the increase in the pain level, but in the end, it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The third day after the first therapy session</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/third-day/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the third day after the first transcranial neurostimulation session. On the first day, as I &lt;a href=&#34;https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/first-transcranial-neurostimulation-appointment/&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; before, a tingling sensation started right after the therapy (well, technically, it began during it), and it increased a little as time went by. In over a year, it was the first time that I felt my body relaxing, so it felt terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the 200km ride back home was tiring. When we got home, I had to go straight to the couch. My body was aching, but not as much as it would before. It felt &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 13th of December, I had my first appointment for transcranial neurostimulation, a promising therapy for dealing - and hopefully fixing - fibromyalgia. I&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about this therapy &lt;a href=&#34;https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-appointment-scheduled/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wife and I drove 200kms to the medical centre, the only one in Portugal with a unit dedicated exclusively to this syndrome, located in Covilhã, a city in the country&amp;rsquo;s interior region. The trip was exhausting; I had to sit for 2 hours and a few minutes, and my body complained a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
