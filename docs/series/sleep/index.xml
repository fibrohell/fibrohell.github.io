      <description>Again, another night awake with terrible back pain. I have a few of these, but I don&amp;rsquo;t write about them every time they happen: I save this for the worst ones. If I did, I would probably write about this once a week on average.
My legs feel numb and painful too, but not as much as my back. I should probably get a hot water bottle, but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit afraid to walk due to the numbness and pain of the legs.</description>

      <title>A week of waking up around 8h like a fucking clock</title>

      <description>Today was a good day. I was able to sleep around 4h and woke up at 10h and a couple of minutes, although I would&amp;rsquo;ve loved to sleep 2 or 3 more hours. The downside is that my back hurts more than usual.
Sleeping 6 hours, give or take a couple of minutes, is an improvement compared to the rest of the week, where I always woke up at 8h, 8h30, even if I fell asleep at 5h.</description>

      <description>This night was another sleepless one. Too much pain, even with hot water bottles. With luck, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to fall asleep for a few hours during the morning or the afternoon. Fingers crossed (not really because they hurt).</description>

      <title>Sleep and fibromyalgia</title>

      <description>I’m no stranger to sleepless nights. I suffer from IBS and, on a bad flare, I would go one or two nights without sleeping. This went on and off for a few years until I could finally control this syndrome and get back to my average 9 hours of sleep.
For a few years after getting the IBS under control, I had no trouble sleeping, even when I got the flu. And then came fibromyalgia.</description>
