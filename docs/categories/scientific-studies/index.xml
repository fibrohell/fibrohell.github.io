      <title>The third day after the first therapy session</title>

      <description>Yesterday was the third day after the first transcranial neurostimulation session. On the first day, as I wrote before, a tingling sensation started right after the therapy (well, technically, it began during it), and it increased a little as time went by. In over a year, it was the first time that I felt my body relaxing, so it felt terrific.
Unfortunately, the 200km ride back home was tiring. When we got home, I had to go straight to the couch.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, if memory serves me right, I watched the news on TV about a centre dedicated to fibromyalgia opening here I&amp;rsquo;m Portugal. They are performing a study using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which got my attention. I searched for publications about this treatment and got my hands on a 2010 research.
In the study, the authors hypothesize, based on previous works, that dysfunctions in the central nervous system related to changes in central pain processing could be the cause.</description>

      <title>The impact of chronic pain in memory and concentration</title>

      <description>In 2007, researchers Dr. Bruce D. Dick and Dr. Saifudin Rashiq, from the University of Alberta&amp;rsquo;s Multidisciplinary Pain Centre in Edmonton, Canada, confirmed chronic pain impairs memory and concentration. Two-thirds of the participants in the research showed significant disruption of attention and memory when tested.
Computerized tests were given to the 24 participants, all of whom had continuous pain lasting for at least six months, to understand the impact of chronic pain on memory. These tests were of working memory and a neuropsychological test of attention.</description>

      <title>List of recent fibromyalgia studies</title>

      <description>I compiled, below, a small list of recent fibromyalgia scientific studies with open access so that people diagnosed with it can better understand the syndrome and find ways to improve symptoms management. Also, people who don&amp;rsquo;t have it can better understand how much patients diagnosed with it suffer.

      <title>Fibromyalgia might be an autoimmune disease</title>

      <description>A recent study points to the hypothesis that fibromyalgia might be an autoimmune disease. The research is being developed by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp;amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London, collaborating with the University of Liverpool and the Karolinska Institute.
Fibromyalgia patients suffer from several symptoms, such as pain sensitivity, muscle weakness, increased fatigue, reduced movement, and reduced number of small nerve fibres in the skin. The research is revealing the root of these symptoms is antibodies that increase the activity of pain-sensing nerves throughout the body.</description>
