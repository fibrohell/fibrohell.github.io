A couple of months ago, more or less (I don't remember the exact date), I was forced by Social Security to request disability. I had previously talked with a fibromyalgia association, and they told me they do this to stop paying the sick leave, which can legally last up to three years in Portugal. Forced, I requested it, but it was denied. The reasoning is that this is a cyclical syndrome. I should have periods with no pain, despite being known this doesn't happen in some cases or, at best, the pain periods are very long, and the low or no pain periods are very short.

Armed with all my medical reports and information, I told them I only experienced high or even higher pain periods. If I had been quiet, the effect would be the same: they don't give a fuck. In fact, it seems they have some bias against this type of syndrome. I've had my fair share of aggressive talk from them and heard a lot of nonsense coming from their mouths.

Since my disability was denied, they stopped paying me sick leave, not for medical reasons whatsoever, but because the disability was rejected. I'm on my second consecutive year of sick leave because I can't work at my current job. Finding one where I can do something and accommodate my limitations has been challenging. I might have better luck creating literal magic than being able to find a job where I can actually do something, despite my limitations.

Now, I have zero income. Zero! I'm already cutting on food and medication. The medication part is making things worse for me because I also have IBS and asthma, but I don't have any other option. I have to work with what I have, which right now is nothing. Luckily, the wife works but doesn't have a fixed income, and we have expenses that need to be paid.

I'm reaching a level of desperation that... Things will become even worse for me at all levels.
