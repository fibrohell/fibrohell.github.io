**My fibromyalgia most intense pain is like a merry-go-round: everything hurts, but the part of my body that hurts the most keeps changing.** One day it's on my lower back, another day is in my shoulder blades, or it's one or both of my legs or my arms.

**In the beginning, it was my lower back that hurt the most.** It stayed like that for several months. Then, it switched to my shoulder blades. **Now it goes around, so it doesn't get bored, I guess.**

As I write this, my left leg and right arm hurt the most. My leg feels like it was smashed, and my forearm like it was beaten with a club.

I want to say this at least keeps things interesting. I do. I would be lying, though. **Having the part of my body that hurts the most changing every time makes everything even more irritating.**

**I want a break from this.** I'm sick of being in pain 24/7, taking many pills that only stop the pain from getting worse, and constantly feeling tired. **A normal life is all I want to have again.** Sadly, I don't think I'll have that again so soon.
