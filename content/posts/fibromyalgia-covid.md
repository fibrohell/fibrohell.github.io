Around two weeks ago, I began to experience Covid-19 symptoms. I was afraid it would make me feel even more pain. Thank Zeus it didn't. My average pain level decreased, but not the peak level.

The Covid-19 symptoms I experienced were a runny nose, expectoration, cough, irritated throat, and an even higher fatigue level. Almost all of them are gone, except for the more significant fatigue feeling. Most days, I feel even more tired and have a more challenging time doing anything.

I'll have to monitor this. I'm curious to see if this will keep for a long time or fade over time and return to my average fatigue level (which is already high, by the way).
