I compiled, below, a small list of recent fibromyalgia scientific studies with open access so that people diagnosed with it can better understand the syndrome and find ways to improve symptoms management. Also, people who don't have it can better understand how much patients diagnosed with it suffer.

### List

- [Fibromyalgiaâ€”A Review for the Psychiatrist](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990568/)

- [Default mode network changes in fibromyalgia patients are largely dependent on current clinical pain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920303633?via%3Dihub)

- [Metabolic fingerprinting for diagnosis of fibromyalgia and other rheumatologic disorders](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)40006-7/fulltext)

- [Is insulin resistance the cause of fibromyalgia? A preliminary report](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216079) - *has a retraction*

- [Passive transfer of fibromyalgia symptoms from patients to mice](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/144201) - _the one hypothesizing the syndrome might be an autoimmune disease_
