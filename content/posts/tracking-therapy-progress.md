Ever since I started transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy, I've wanted an easy way for me to keep track of its effects. I carried out trials with a few methods, but they all fell short.

First, I experimented with writing text/markdown/org files, but it got messier as the notes grew. Then, dedicated simple note-taking software like Google Keep, but this method had the same issues as the text files. I needed context, relationships and simple search, and none of the methods above had all of these prerequisites.

One application, however, had been on my radar, but I never got to give it a go. I honestly can't remember why; I only know that I now regret it. I'm talking about Logseq. [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is an outliner, but so much more. Here is how I use it:

- The journal feature helps me to keep track of the daily progress I make after every appointment with both tags and backlinks;
- I have dedicated pages to list all the notes about specific appointments and related progress;
- I have dedicated pages to scientific studies, pages to list all the studies, and tags to classify them;
- I use the highlight options to link specific parts of PDFs from studies in pages or journals;
- I compile information with all the above for blog posts;
- I can embed page blocks onto other pages for easier reference;
- Etc.

The sky is the limit with [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). I truly recommend it if you want to keep track of your progress with any therapy or medication you're taking for your fibromyalgia. But you can also use it for your studies, save recipes and so on.

Logseq's potential not only is immense, but it brought order to my tired and chaotic mind. I give it 20 out of 10!
