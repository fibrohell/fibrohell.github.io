I was thinking about only writing about my fifth low intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation after a few days. Still, because I didn't feel a significant decrease in pain, I decided to write a blog post today.

The appointment was yesterday. It came after one of the worst months, just like last month. Also, I've felt the average pain intensity has increased. Those are two factors that should be accounted for when judging the effects of the treatment.
After the appointment, I felt a lot of relief, but less than with the previous appointments. Even the previous one made me feel less pain, and that one didn't provide as much pain relief as the previous ones.

On the ride home, my body started to ache more than usual. It's a two-hour ride, so a bit of pain is expected, but what I felt was a lot more than usual.

The pain increased a bit during the afternoon, but nothing I would consider too serious. I went to bed around 9 PM and fell asleep around 9:30 PM.

Today, I woke up around 1 PM feeling a lot of pain. I slept a considerable amount of hours, probably in the same position most of the night because I spent the previous one awake. The tiredness makes me stay in the same position for several hours, so I was expecting some pain, but not as much. It felt like the last day of relief after the first three appointments. My muscles were stiff and aching like crazy.

During the day, I ended up taking a boiling shower. This is something I've never done in the first days after an appointment. Even now, after taking another 200mg of tramadol, my body is screaming in pain.

This is the second time [in a row] I leave an appointment feeling less relief. I should account for the last two months, some of the worse I've had, and the normal pain levels have increased. Even so, I'm afraid my body may be getting used to the therapy. If it's that, it's not good news for me.
