I thought my sleep issues mainly had stabilized for a few months now. I have, on average, two nights without sleep, but that's it. Long gone are the days when I slept, at most, twelve hours in a whole week. Or so I thought...

The last two weeks have been... hum... demanding in that regard. When I sleep, it's usually six hours top, with one sleeping between ten and twelve because the fatigue builds up and eventually gets too much to bear. The sleepless nights have been three a week. And the sleep quality hasn't been that great, either.

I hope this gets better, but I'm unsure of it. It seems my rest is about to get another beat.
