**When I started feeling the pain caused by fibromyalgia, I was forced to avoid tasks like cleaning the house.** I tried to do it before deciding I shouldn't, but it hurt like hell and I couldn't finish It, so I had to let my beautiful wife do this one. Other tasks, however, I was able to keep doing, like cooking, but I had to adapt the way I do them.

**And it's about how I adapted the way I do cooking I'm writing. Cooking forces me to stand up with minimal movement, and that causes me even more pain.** My back hurts more, I get pain in the legs and it feels like I can sense every nerve and muscle fibre on them being stretched to the point of almost breakage.

### How I did it

Because of this, **I began dividing the cooking into small steps, with rest time between them to reduce the pain until I could do the next step.** Sometimes I even need to put a hot water bottle in my back to help with the unbearable pain.

Although I'm writing about cooking, I **apply this "task step > rest > task step > rest" to putting the clothes to wash and hang them to dry, tidy the house** (only the small tasks that need to be done because I can't handle a complete cleaning), **and every other chore**.

### Do I do it every time I'm in pain?

**I'm always in pain 24/7. The only thing that changes is the intensity.** There are occasions when I can't even force myself to get out of bed.
