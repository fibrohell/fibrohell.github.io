On the 10th, the wife and I went to a park within walking distance from home to celebrate her negative Covid test. It takes less than 5 minutes to get there on foot. Still, it took us ~15 minutes because I was walking super slow and with considerable difficulties.

When we arrived, I was with one foot to the grave. I had to sit for a while (but I actually wanted to lay down on the floor), and then I proceeded to take some photos. I felt super happy hanging out with her in a lovely park and shooting pictures, which depleted my energy.

The return home took even more time. As soon as my body cooled down, it felt like I had been run over by an entire fleet of trucks. My body is entirely soared, and my muscles feel like they are pulsating.

I had a blast, but I'll pay my dues for it at least during the next few days. The doctors say I should do some light exercise, but if a short, slow walk to a park left me in this state, I don't want to imagine how much pain I would feel if I did something more than walking...

One day of fun, a few with more suffering.
