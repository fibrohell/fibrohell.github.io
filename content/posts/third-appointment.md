Yesterday, the 10th, I had my third transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment. Unlike [last time](https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/second-appointment/), there was no delay; I believe it was because I was the day's first patient. I'll probably be the first again on the next one because it's scheduled for the same hour as yesterday. Even if I'm not the first, I'll be one of the first, which means I probably won't have to wait much.

Again, I felt that fantastic relaxation feeling in my body. This time, it started during the first part of the treatment, not by the end like the previous two appointments, and only increased from there. When I left the office, I was smiling. That was crazy!

After the last appointment, the decrease in pain prevailed for four days. Before that one, it lasted two days. This time, I'm really hoping for a whole week with a level two of pain (this would be a level 4 before the fibromyalgia). Fingers crossed!

I am very excited about the potential of this treatment in helping me get my life back, my energy, my brain performance, my joy to live. I don't fool myself into thinking this is a silver bullet. It probably isn't. However, the positive effects are undeniable, which means - quoting The Mandalorian - "this is the way".
