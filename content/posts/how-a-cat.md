It's been more than two months since I last published something here. During this time, I've mostly felt the same as I always do: pain and fatigue. I can't forget the difficulties sleeping, the crappy memory, and the lack of motivation for everything, even getting out of bed.

Ten days ago, however, we got a six-month-old cat. This was the first time I felt genuinely excited in over two years! My days were mostly spent alone at home, watching something and/or browsing the web to pass the time; sometimes, I even played Football Manager if I had the mental energy to do it. I only got company at night when my wife arrived from work, but by then, I was feeling even more tired, unmotivated, and with no focus ability. Now, I have Chico Petisco to keep me company and *chill* with me on the couch.

Chico spent almost six months in a shed. His previous owners have a dog, and he hates cats. To avoid getting injured, they kept him in the shed, and the only contact he had with people was when they fed him. This translated into learning undesired behaviors that I'm now trying to fix.

This experience, though tiring, has been fun. The best thing, however, is feeling excited. I had forgotten how that felt.
