Again, another night awake with terrible back pain. I have a few of these, but I don't write about them every time they happen: I save this for the worst ones. If I did, I would probably write about this once a week on average.

My legs feel numb and painful too, but not as much as my back. I should probably get a hot water bottle, but I'm a bit afraid to walk due to the numbness and pain of the legs. Shit's bad.

With luck, I'll be able to fall asleep eventually, maybe for a few hours during the morning or the afternoon. Let's see how this goes. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to listen to a [Chillhop live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDL4szIde_o) I found. The music is soothing. ï»¿ðŸ™‚ï»¿
