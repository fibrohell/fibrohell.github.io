On the 16th, I'll be 39, and I've never been more terrified of my future in my whole life. The pain has been getting more intense in the last few months, and I fear it will worsen.

My days are spent lying down on the couch and/or on the bed, feeling pain 24/7, not resting well when I'm able to sleep, not sleeping because the pain keeps me awake, and having my brain totally fucked up and tired... I'm frightened about my future. It scares the shit out of me to have to live the rest of my life like this.

I feel like I'm stuck at a very painful crossroad with no idea how to get out of it. I'm not even sure if I'll ever be able to get out of it.

On top of this, I feel like I'm a hindrance to everyone around me.

My future feels tremendously dark.
