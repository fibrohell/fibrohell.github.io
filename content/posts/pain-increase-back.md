I thought the effects would last longer when I published the previous blog post. I wasn't sure about them enduring a whole week, but at least five days. Not this time; maybe next time. Even so, it lasted longer than last month, so I call it progress, and I keep myself hopeful about this treatment!

Thirty minutes, more or less, after publishing that blog post, I started feeling an increase in the pain intensity. It went from a 2.0, on a scale of 0 to 10, to a 4.5 in a heartbeat.

Bear in mind that my pain scale is not what it used to be, and it contemplates the impact on the brain. A 2.0 used to be a 3.0 before fibromyalgia; then it got equivalent to a 4.0; now a 5.0. When I mention a 2.0 level, it doesn't mean mild pain. Well, it is mild if I compare it to a 10, the worst pain level I have had so far - thank Zeus, only once.

The pain kept at that level for a few hours, enough to mess with my sleep. I was only able to fall asleep past 4 AM. The sleep fatigue was so intense at that time that tears were falling down my face. I even got some pain in the jaw because I was yawning so much.

Eventually, I managed to sleep, only to be awakened a couple of minutes past 8 AM with the wife complaining about Firefox being super slow and making her computer also slow. After trying a few things, it sorted out itself. I later found out she received an email, from the company providing the tool she uses at work, about a bug in the updated version they released to production. I guess they don't do tests.

After everything started working again, I went straight to bed and eventually fell asleep, only to wake up at 3 PM with my body soaring. I took the chance to stay a bit longer in bed until the muscles relaxed so I wouldn't feel much pain. They eventually did, and I spent the rest of the day - and now too - with a 4.5 pain level.
