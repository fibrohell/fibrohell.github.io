Another common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is people asking why someone is in pain if the medical exams show nothing wrong. There is also a variation of the above question: people asking why chronic pain sufferers are in pain if they don't have anything physically wrong.

Those are also annoying. Infuriating, I might add. Again, I won't judge the intention when people ask these questions. However, I can't help but ponder if people think through these questions and their impact before asking them.

Lack of physical signs doesn't mean a fibromyalgia patient isn't in pain. Being asked these types of questions can be tiresome. People should instead ask how patients feel, how they deal with it, and what fibromyalgia is.
