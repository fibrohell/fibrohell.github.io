Today was a good day. I was able to sleep around 4h and woke up at 10h and a couple of minutes, although I would've loved to sleep 2 or 3 more hours. The downside is that my back hurts more than usual.

Sleeping 6 hours, give or take a couple of minutes, is an improvement compared to the rest of the week, where I always woke up at 8h, 8h30, even if I fell asleep at 5h.
