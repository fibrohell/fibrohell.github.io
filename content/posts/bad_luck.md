Over the last decade, my health has taken a toll. It wasn't anything serious to the point of getting hospitalized, but severe enough to put me through some hardships I could've lived without and completely mess my life. I'm talking about Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS for short).

While not life-threatening, I have a severe form of this syndrome. In most cases, people have light symptoms; I, however, can't go without medication, can't get too stressed and can't eat a lot of stuff. Well, sometimes, even the things I eat causes me pain.

A few years ago, I finally managed to control it. That's when I found out I had developed lactose intolerance. It was a game-changer moment.

All seemed well after this. I could work without going on sick leave; my intestines stopped giving me constant cramps and messed up bowel movements; no more feeling like it was being twisted to the point of rupture.

It was a relief.

A few years later, I got pain in my lower back. Since then, not only didn't stop, but it got worst and spread to almost every part of my body.

When I thought I could chase my life goals, I got _kicked in the balls_. Life, it seems, likes to mess with me or some shit like that. Maybe it's a sadist. Perhaps it's just messed up.

Fuck this shit!!

Some of my plans and life goals will likely go unfulfilled. I try to be the strongest I can be, not letting it take me down; I try to lift my chin and continue forward. I can't afford to go down in sorrow.

I have to be the best I can be under the circumstances I'm in. I can't afford a lot of shit because of that, not even boil up and explode in anger. I can't scream. I can't... I don't even know what.

Fuck this shit!!

Maybe it's all bad luck.
