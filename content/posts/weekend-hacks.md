All the doctors I've seen have told me I need to leave the house and mingle. I hadn't done it much because I'm always in pain, and spending a day with the family can be exhausting and painful. I took their advice and every Sunday I try to spend it with my parents or her parents.

Doing it and avoiding the crazy amount of fatigue and pain associated with these days takes some planning. I can't spend all day standing up, but I also can't spend it sitting down on uncomfortable chairs, or I'll be in a lot of pain.

The solution I found so I don't get drained and my body aching to crazy levels is taking the camera to grab some pictures. After lunch, I always grab it and go on a short walk to snap some photos. Strolling for a bit puts the hard pain at bay, and I can do a hobby I love: photography.

Of course, snapping photos also takes a toll. When I start to feel more tired, I sit in a less uncomfortable chair to recover my energy and rest my body. I do it for thirty to sixty minutes, and then I return to take photographs. On some days, the worst ones, I rest on a couch instead of a chair.

Despite the hacks I employ to get through the day, I need to lay down on the couch to rest when I get home. If I don't, I probably won't sleep at night. Even If I do, there are days where I can't sleep.
