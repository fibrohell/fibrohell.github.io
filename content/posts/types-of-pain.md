Ever since my pain started, I've experienced what I would classify as three different types of pain: two of them are more common, and one is rare. Usually, I feel one of them with high intensity and another with low intensity; on occasion, the three simultaneously have the same intenseness or different levels.

The most common ones are:

- Feeling soared, like after receiving a solid kick in the muscles or being hit with a baseball bat (or something like that);
- Like having needles piercing my muscles.

The rarer one feels like I'm having my nerves being pulled with a hook.

All of them hurt like hell.

Feeling a shit ton of soared muscles with high intensity and pierced muscles with lower intensity is the most common type of pain combination. What doesn't happen that often, thank Satan, is feeling the three with the same level of intensity. On those days, I avoid moving as much as possible, so the pain doesn't increase even more.

Since yesterday, when I was making dinner, I've felt the three of them with the same intensity. It has been insane, to say the least. The intensity is an 8 on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (max pain). This pain scale is the revised one: what is now a level 5 pain would be an 8 before fibromyalgia; this current level 8 would go off the charts with the previous scale.

As you might imagine, this completely fucks my concentration. Writing this small text took far too long compared to my average pain level, and I had to stop a few times. Also, it messes with my already low ability to cook, just to give an example.
