Today is one of those days I don't even get some pain relief by lying down. Well, it started yesterday, when I woke up. I don't know if it was for sleeping too much time in the same position, bad luck, or whatever the fuck it was, but all I know is I woke up in tremendous pain.

My body feels like it's broken and all soared. My arms, legs, lower back, and shoulder blades all hurt a lot. And I mean a lot! Writing this is painful, and I have to do it slowly, or I might scream. I can't even think straight.

The pain kept me up at night, as you might imagine. To distract myself - or at least try - I took a look at almost 800 photos I shot since October and didn't have the energy and focus on selecting. Picking the images kept me a little occupied, but it didn't do much to distract me from the pain; I had to stop several times.

The... hum... *upside*... is I selected a few lovely photographs from when I went with the wife to a village named Penacova. She took her mother to take the third Covid shot, and I went with her to keep her company. We went to a spot with a freaking beautiful view to pass the time. Having the leaves with autumn colours made the experience even better.

Of course, being in a cool place, I had to take a few photos. That helped me distract from the pain and the brain fog for a bit. I was exhausted but happy to have taken some nice photographs by the end of it.

The photograph I'm using in this blog post is one I took of those I took there.

However, if that happened today, it wouldn't make a difference. I probably wouldn't take photos or even keep the wife company. Today is a very, very bad day.
