When I'm in pain, which is every second of every day, I try to find stuff that helps me distract from it. I can only do most of them when I'm not also feeling exhausted, a state that I'm frequently in.

If I have the energy, I do at least one of the following:
- talk to the wife when she's at home
- call my parents
- visit my parents or my in-laws
- snap some photographs
- volunteer with [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org)
- watch TV
- listen to some [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gFhR0cDZHuGGCCGhgDjAB?si=00d1925bf7b64b27)
- read online articles
- play Football Manager

Having activities to do is, I believe, very important to keep the mind as sane as possible and avoid going through the rabbit hole of depression. People struggling with chronic pain know what I'm talking about.

In case you don't have chronic pain, keep in mind that feeling pain 24/7 messes with the brain, which puts the person in a depressive state. Then, you have two things to fight: depression and pain.

These are the activities I do to distract myself from the pain. What are yours? Share them in the comments.
