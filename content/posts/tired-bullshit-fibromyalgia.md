I'm so sick of the bullshit around fibromyalgia. The latest I've read is an [*article*](https://sicnoticias.pt/saude-e-bem-estar/2023-05-12-Fibromialgia-O-medico-escreveu-felicidade-num-papel-e-deu-mo.-Foi-tudo-o-que-eu-precisei-d08b49a2) on a Portuguese news channel website about happiness as an almost miraculous cure for this syndrome. What a bunch of steaming, stinky shit! Five fucking minutes on a search engine, and the reporter would've found actual medical information about this. Three examples follow below:

- [Autoantibodies: a possible contributor to fibromyalgia](https://news.ki.se/autoantibodies-a-possible-contributor-to-fibromyalgia)
- [New Review Highlights Autoimmune Roots of Unexplained Chronic Pain](https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/news/new-review-highlights-autoimmune-roots-of-unexplained-chronic-pain)
- [Mouse Study Reveals An Immune Cell That May Cause Fibromyalgia](https://www.sciencealert.com/mouse-study-reveals-an-immune-cell-that-may-cause-fibromyalgia)

Shit like this creates a lot of obstacles to getting actual help. Instead, it helps perpetuate the habit of dosing patients with antidepressants instead of prescribing medication that actually helps deal with the pain. I'm struggling with this: my meds barely have any impact on my pain management, and I can't get a doctor to prescribe anything stronger because... happiness, antidepressants, and all that bullshit.

Stop reporting crap like this for the love of Zeus!
