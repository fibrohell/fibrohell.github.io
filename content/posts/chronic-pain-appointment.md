Yesterday I had a chronic pain appointment. It was insanely painful! I had to wait almost an hour to see the doctor, sitting in super uncomfortable chairs, and left there with more pain than when I entered.

This fucked up my sleep completely. I spent the night awake, in a lot of pain. After returning home, I prepared five (or was it six? i lost count) hot water bottles and had to take a boiling bath. It took me more than twelve hours to start to feel some very minor relief, and that wasn't enough to allow me to sleep, even if by morning. I'm super sleepy, but I can sleep because I'm still in too much pain.

This is not the first chronic pain appointment I have had. Like in the previous ones, I left there wondering if it's worth it to continue them. The more I ponder it, the more I feel they're worthless.
