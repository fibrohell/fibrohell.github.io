Since the Fibromyalgia pain started, **I've been forced to classify my days into four categories: *good, bad, very bad, and very very bad*.** The classification depends on the pain I feel and on how disabled I get.

**The rarest of them is *good*.** These days are almost as elusive as a neoliberal caring for anything else other than himself.

I had a few of these almost a year ago, in December 2020. The pain was still present, but the level was low, and I could go on with my life without worrying much if an activity or movement would make my body hurt more.

***Bad* days are somewhat frequent, and the most common ones are *very bad days*.** I can prepare meals during *bad* days without taking breaks, but everything hurts more after finishing and I have to lay down. On *very bad* days, I have to cook in small steps, with rest periods between them. [I've written about this before](https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/how-i-cook-and-avoid-increase-in-pain/).

**That leaves *very very bad* days. These are just a little less frequent than *bad* days.** I've had my share of them so far and, although I don't recommend them, I thought they couldn't get worse. Boy, how wrong I was.

It was the 11th of November. **I woke up feeling a lot of pain in the morning, and the intensity increased throughout the day. By the afternoon that day, I was convinced I was having another *very very bad* day.** I dragged myself to prepare a hot water bottle, hoping to relieve the pain.

When the heat was intense, the pain decreased a bit. After that, it continued to increase.

**At night, it was at the level of my worst pain day until then.** I popped the pills and went to bed to try to get some sleep. I think you probably guessed that sleep was something I couldn't do.

The following day, the pain level was even more prominent. **I was officially in my worst pain day so far, but that shit continued to increase slowly.**

**On the 14th of November, it seemed to have stabilized.** **Yet, I was in unbearable pain like I had never felt.** Even the slightest movement hurt like... I can't even describe it; this shit was beyond horrible.

**Eventually, on the 17th, it started to decrease slowly.** Two days later, it was back to the regular *very very bad* day. Now, as I write this blog post, it's just on a "boring" *very bad* day.

**I have no idea what triggered this flare. Swear to Goku!** Maybe it was stress, bad luck, or the syndrome giving a glimpse of what's coming up in the future. I have no fucking idea!

The only thing I do know is I don't want another day like that. **It wasn't only the pain but also the brain fog and the fatigue trailing new higher levels.** The whole experience was something to forget and hope not to repeat. And if it was like this with medication, I surely don't want to imagine how it would have been without it.
