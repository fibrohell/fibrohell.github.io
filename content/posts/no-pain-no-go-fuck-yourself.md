I just say the above picture posted by [u/mordrathe](https://reddit.com/u/mordrathe) on [/r/ChronicPain](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/rs3r64/so_much_gain/) about that amazingly stupid catchphrase "No pain, no gain" and it hit home. After spending almost 18 months in constant pain, I gained so much disdain for it!
