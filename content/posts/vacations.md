The wife is on vacation this week, and, since last week, she's been trying to butter me up to go with her to the beach because she knows how painful these things can be for me, and I usually decline. We haven't done something like this in a while, so we both wanted to do something.

On Monday, we arrived a little before lunch so we could eat something and then chill in the sand for a while. We were fortunate enough to find a seat in a restaurant a few meters from the beach, but not so much with the waiting time. When we started eating, my lower back was hurting like crazy - I couldn't even stop shaking my leg.

With our bellies full and my back in severe pain, we went very slowly to the beach. I couldn't even stay there for a full hour. I had assumed the sand would be very uncomfortable, so I tried to flatten the sand where we laid down, but that didn't make any difference. I had to lay down in a weird position, supporting part of my weight in one arm and ending up with it hurting insanely too, so I could just stand there for around 30 minutes.

All of this was on Monday. As I type this, it's already Thursday, and I still feel my body wholly soared and broken.
