It's already past 1 AM here in Portugal. I was expecting yesterday would be a day with more pain than usual, just like last month, three days after my first transcranial magnetic stimulation appointment.

Pessimistic as it may sound, I believe it's better, in this particular case, to be prepared for the worse in case it happens. If it doesn't, it's a nice and pleasant surprise, don't you agree?

Well, the worst-case scenario didn't come to fruition. My body hurt more than the day of the appointment and the next day after it, but it was manageable. I admit I didn't do much yesterday, but that was also the case in basically all my worst pain days.

What a pleasant surprise this is! I'm happy and excited! Hell yeah!

I wanted the effects to last a whole week this time; however, I admit I'm surprised I'm still feeling them. Will they last as long as I hope they do? Don't miss the next episode, because I won't either. I couldn't miss it even if I wanted to.
