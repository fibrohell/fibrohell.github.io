By now, I should've been used to how the pain changes and fluctuates. I am not. I can't get used to having the most hurting part of my body change from one place to the other, causing mixed difficulties as it travels - usually on my upper body. And I can't get used to the changes in intensity, always between high levels.

Since about two weeks ago, I have had one more shit to get used to: having multiple regions of my body with maximum pain intensity at the same time. Yes: not one part of the body with the highest pain level, but two or more.

Bring the drinks. We have something to celebrate! /s

It used to be only one area with the most pain: the lower back would hurt the most, for example, and the rest wouldn't ache as much but still hurt like hell.

I have no idea how and why the tune changed, but I can now have my lower back and my left shoulder blade, for example, with the highest pain levelâ€”or feeling a handful of spots in my back with the highest pain level at the same time.

This change feels worst and makes me feel more pain and more tired. Also, it messes even more with my sleep.
