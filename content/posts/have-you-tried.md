One common complaint I see on /r/fibromyalgia and /r/chronicpain is the questions chronic pain sufferers get asked about if they tried some random stuff, sometimes followed by an "it worked for me for my _random non-chronic pain_. "Your all body hurts? Try Yoga".

These questions can be more than annoying. They can be irritating. I won't judge the intention when people ask these questions; I only wonder if they really think people living with chronic pain haven't tried everything they could possibly imagine to relieve the pain.

**_Of course we want to live with constant pain and have our life fucked up. Who wouldn't?!_**
