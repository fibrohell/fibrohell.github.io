For the last few days, the pain intensity has been increasing steadily. I was hoping it was only a fad, and things would stabilize on a somewhat manageable pain level. Again, luck had other plans for me.

Things have been bad, but today tops the last week. I woke up with a crazy ton of pain in my body, and it took me more than one hour to get out of bed - my muscles were (and are) really stiff and soared.

After taking my meds, I went straight to the shower. The hot water felt good on my back and provided me with a short-timed relief.

However, it didn't take long for me to put a hot water bottle on my back. After the quick relief I had with the bath, the pain galloped again like a crypto bro defending whatever crypto scheme is going on at any given moment. Even my jaw hurts like crazy!

I guess the crazy pain days are back. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
