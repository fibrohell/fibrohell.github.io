I’ve been seeing this image on some subreddits, and I can’t imagine how great it would be if my pain was a never-ending, low-level one. I swear to Cthulhu, it would be amazing! No more sleepless nights because the pain is too much to bear, so much less brain fog and fucked up memory. Granted, I do have a couple of days of relief after the appointments, but even that starts to degrade fast hours after finishing the treatment session.
