The Hellidays are gone, and my body is happy with that. Christmas Eve was on a Sunday and Christmas on a Saturday. Then came Sunday, like the third day of the Hellidays. What a fucking beaten it was for me.

On Christmas Eve, I stayed at home during the morning and almost all afternoon. Thank Zeus for that. I couldn't sleep the previous night, only a few hours during the morning. The afternoon was to rest my body and do hot water bottles to ease the pain. At night, I had dinner with my parents and the wife, we chatted for a couple of hours while I was resting my body, and then we left.

The wife and I spent Christmas day with my in-laws. As you might have guessed, I barely slept again because I was in pain. I spent most of the day on the couch, of course, trying to recover from sitting for lunch and dinner, mingling with the few guests, and snapping photos. Oh, and eat desserts.

Then came Sunday, the "third" day of the Hellidays. Again, I only slept a few hours... and yes, I was in fucking pain and exhaustion. A lot of both! The couch was where I spent most of the day. My level of tiredness and pain was so significant that I didn't even take photographs. And love photography!

Now, I'm at home, it's 03:25 as I type this, and I can't sleep because my back hurts insanely, and my legs aren't much better either! At least my fingers are not hurting much and the Hellidays are finally hover. Silver linings, I guess.

On the other hand, the brain is not in the best shape. I'm typing with a lot of errors (thank Cthulhu for integrated spell checkers and Grammarly); almost all the words I type have at least one wrong letter in them. I usually don't have this kind of issue when I'm writing, and it's making me mad.

I don't know if I'll be able to sleep during the night or only fall asleep from weariness during the morning or afternoon. I merely want the pain to decrease enough to let me sleep.
