Today, I presented myself before Social Security's medical board. I waited almost an hour and didn't wait even more because the other people there saw my suffering and were very kind and asked them to let me cut the line.

I'll continue on paid sick leave. As I was leaving, the "doctors" in the medical board told me it was a Christmas gift. I'm not kidding. Those fuckers mocked me and my disability. I left their facilities feeling like shit.

Besides having my life affected by fibromyalgia and being in pain 24/7, I'm mocked by the professionals on the medical board. To me, this is a complete lack of ethics.

I could've asked the complaint book, but, honestly, I didn't have the energy for that. Also, I'm afraid to suffer retaliation the next time I go to these medical boards if I make a formal complaint about them and their lack of ethics.
