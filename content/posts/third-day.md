Yesterday was the third day after the first transcranial neurostimulation session. On the first day, as I [wrote](https://fibrohell.github.io/posts/first-transcranial-neurostimulation-appointment/) before, a tingling sensation started right after the therapy (well, technically, it began during it), and it increased a little as time went by. In over a year, it was the first time that I felt my body relaxing, so it felt terrific.

Unfortunately, the 200km ride back home was tiring. When we got home, I had to go straight to the couch. My body was aching, but not as much as it would before. It felt _good_.

On the second day, I woke up in an upbeat mood. Although I felt pain throughout my body, it didn't hurt as much, and I was able to cook without any hacks to avoid more pain, and my brain was sharper than it has been since the fibromyalgia symptoms started.

This change of pace felt genuinely good! 

Then came the third day, yesterday. When I woke up, I felt cosy and warm in bed. I stayed in bed for around 20 minutes, give or take, then got up. Shit went downhill from there.

The pain started increasing in an instant; it almost felt like the pain before the first session. As the hours went by, it kept growing, particularly on my back - everything hurt a lot, from the shoulder blades to the lower back. My arms ached too, but much less than the back.

The pain forced me to spend most of the day lying on the couch. Fortunately, I only had to make pasta for lunch because the wife had cooked chicken the day before. At dinner, we ate the leftovers.

The only other times I got up were going to the bathroom, making coffee and chocolate milk, smoking, and coming to bed to get some sleep. This last part is still an ongoing task: the pain is high enough to mess with my sleep.

Since I can't sleep right now, I'm taking the chance to write this and report on my progress with transcranial neurostimulation therapy. I had a bit of an improvement before getting like I was before, so I call this progress. Fingers crossed!
