Two weeks ago, if memory serves me right, I watched the news on TV about a centre dedicated to fibromyalgia opening here I'm Portugal. They are performing a study using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which got my attention. I searched for publications about this treatment and got my hands on a 2010 research.

In the study, the authors hypothesize, based on previous works, that dysfunctions in the central nervous system related to changes in central pain processing could be the cause.

To put it to the test, they performed a double-blind study to focus on the long-term effects on patients. Noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to one of the groups in the primary motor cortex. The other received a sham treatment.

For 21 weeks, 14 stimulation sessions were performed, with one follow-up visit on the 25th week. First, a session per day was performed during the first five days, followed by a maintenance phase of a weekly session during three weeks, three fortnightly sessions and three monthly sessions.

After the sessions, patients reported a decrease in pain. Also, they reported an improvement in fatigue, sleep, walking and enjoyment of life. These effects lasted up to six months.

After reading parts of the study (I haven't found the focus to read all the information), I got excited and contacted this new centre I mentioned above to see if I could participate. Sadly, they already have all the candidates.

Not being able to participate in the study, I asked to make an appointment with the doctor/investigator and start the treatment. They told me they have all the December booked but asked for my contact information so they could call me to schedule an appointment.

I hope they don't take too long. I'm so tired of constantly feeling pain 24/7. Being like this is exhausting, both physically and mentally. An everyday, boring life is all I want. Is that too much to ask?
