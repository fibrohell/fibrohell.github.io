## Introduction

It was around the last days of July 2020 and I was on one of my days off from work. After lunch, I decided to rest on the couch instead of washing the dishes right away. Thirty minutes or so later, I started feeling an acute pain in my lower back that I can only describe has a muscle being ripped apart. Since that day, the pain spread to every part of my body except the head, and the intensity increased. Now, my days are either bad, very bad or very very bad.
